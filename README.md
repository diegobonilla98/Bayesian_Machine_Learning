# Bayesian_Machine_Learning
Some algorithms demonstrating the algorithms in Bayesian Statistics for Machine Learning purposes. 

Recently I took a course in Bayesian Machine Learning and here are some of the resulting work learned. This upload is for the evaluation of the instructor and for future uses for me.

Some of the algorithms/subjects on the scripts are Chi_Square test, p-value, beta or gaussian distributions, ... among other +- basic statistics.

The scripts use the Bandits problem as a statistic problem and use the scipy library for statistic functions. All of these encapsulated on a Click-Through-Rate problem environment with Bernouilli distribution.
